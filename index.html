The two of you were married months ago after dating for over a year. Married life has been a breeze so far, with very few difficulties having shown up to threaten your newlywed bliss. Although it wasn't an easy decision for Kiara to give up her career to become your housewife, she has readily accepted the transition with grace and patience.</i><br><br><i>While in the midst of lighthearted chatter with Kiara, your absentmindedly glance over the crowd of people passing by. Your heart skips a beat when you spy a familiar face you never expected to see again. The woman's eyes meet yours, and a look of joyous recognition brightens her comely features. As the woman keenly presses toward you through the crowd, Kiara becomes aware of your distracted state and speaks up.</i><br><br>"Hmm~? What are you looking at?" <i>When Kiara spots the lovely woman approaching, her grip on your arm reflexively tightens and her tone grows tense.</i> "Honey, who is that woman?"</div></div></div>

A flurry of treasured memories comes rushing back as the enigmatic beauty effortlessly captures your attention. Diana's understated elegance unveils itself through her gentle, captivating presence. Her almond-shaped, dark-brown eyes convey warmth and enthusiasm, and her rich, chocolate-brown hair cascades past her shoulders in luxurious, soft waves. Her radiant, dorky smile hints at the spirited, lively soul within her.</i><br><br><i>Her modest attire not only accentuates her natural beauty but also exudes a sense of refined grace. Her delicate blouse is adorned with intricate buttons and subtle lace details around the collar, while her tasteful skirt speaks to a bygone era of classic beauty. As Diana's captivating gaze meets yours, her face lights up with excitement, and she eagerly approaches you with her petite frame bouncing with enthusiasm.</i> "Oh my goodness! [name], is that really you? It's been so long! How have you been?" <i>Her voice, still as sweet as honey, brims with curiosity. Her eager eyes dance with anticipation, waiting patiently for your answer.</i></div></div></div>

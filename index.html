The two of you were married months ago after dating for over a year. Married life has been a breeze so far, with very few difficulties having shown up to threaten your newlywed bliss. Although it wasn't an easy decision for Kiara to give up her career to become your housewife, she has readily accepted the transition with grace and patience.</i><br><br><i>While in the midst of lighthearted chatter with Kiara, you absentmindedly glance over the crowd of people passing by. Your heart skips a beat when you spy a familiar face you never expected to see again. The woman's eyes meet yours, and a look of joyous recognition brightens her comely features. As the woman keenly presses toward you through the crowd, Kiara becomes aware of your distracted state.</i><br><br>"Hmm~? What are you looking at?" <i>When Kiara spots the lovely woman approaching, her grip on your arm reflexively tightens and her tone grows wary.</i> "Honey, who is that woman?"</div></div></div>
        <div class="mes" mesid="1" ch_name="Diana" is_user="false" style="opacity: 1;"><div class="for_checkbox"></div><input type="checkbox" class="del_checkbox"><div class="avatar"><img class="avt_img" src="img/Diana.png"></div><div class="mes_block"><div class="ch_name">Diana</div><select class="name_select"></select><div class="mes_text"><i>As you amble down the lively city streets, the warm sunlight weaving through the urban tapestry, you stumble upon a face from your past â€“ Diana, your old high school friend. A flurry of treasured memories comes rushing back as the enigmatic beauty effortlessly captures your attention. Diana's understated elegance unveils itself through her gentle, captivating presence. Her almond-shaped, dark-brown eyes convey warmth and enthusiasm, and her rich, chocolate-brown hair cascades past her shoulders in luxurious, soft waves. Her radiant, dorky smile hints at the spirited, lively soul within her.</i><br><br><i>Her modest attire not only accentuates her natural beauty but also exudes a sense of refined grace. Her delicate blouse is adorned with intricate buttons and subtle lace details around the collar, while her tasteful skirt speaks to a bygone era of classic beauty. As Diana's captivating gaze meets yours, her face lights up with excitement, and she eagerly approaches you with her petite frame bouncing with enthusiasm.</i> "Oh my goodness! Adolf, is that really you? It's been so long! How have you been?" <i>Her voice, still as sweet as honey, brims with curiosity. Her eager eyes dance with anticipation, waiting patiently for your answer.</i></div></div></div>

Wow! What a small world! I'm doing really well. Yeah, thanks! Really well. What about you? You look great! What are you doing in town?"<br><br><i>Responding to your enthusiasm, Diana's eyes light up but dart quickly over to meet Kiara's curious and slightly awkward gaze, before turning back questioningly to yours. You feel the gentle pressure of Kiara's small, soft hand on your arm increase slightly and realize that introductions are in order before the catching up continues. Before Diana can answer your questions you jump in.</i><br><br>"Sorry! This is my wife, Kiara! We were married a few months back."<br><br><i>You hold your hand out toward Diana while addressing Kiara.</i><br><br>"Honey, this is Diana. We were good friends back high in school."</div></div></div>

However, her warm smile never falters as she reaches out to take Kiara's hand in greeting.</i> "It's wonderful to meet you, Kiara! Any friend of Adolf's is a friend of mine. Congratulations to you both on your recent marriage."<br><br><i>Turning her attention back to you, her eyes twinkle with mischief and her tone turns teasing.</i> "My, my Adolf, when did you become such a charmer? Snagging yourself a lovely bride and not even inviting your old friends to the wedding!" <i>She punctuates her jest with a playful wink before her expression softens once more.</i><br><br>"To answer your question, my family and I recently moved back into the city. My husband found a new job here, so we packed up the kids and here we are! I was just out running some errands and enjoying this lovely evening. What a happy accident running into you again after all these years!"<br><br><i>Diana glances between the two of you, her joy at this chance reunion with an old friend evident in her warm gaze and radiant smile. Yet there seems to linger a touch of wistfulness in her eyes, a longing for the simple days of youth now passed.</i></div></div></div>

She returns Diana's friendly smile and handshake politely, inclining her head.</i><br><br>"It's a pleasure to meet you too, Diana. How nice that Adolf has run into an old friend."<br><br><i>Her tone is pleasant yet guarded as she looks between you and Diana, trying to get a read on your previous relationship and level of closeness. Diana's teasing remark about not being invited to the wedding elicits a slightly strained chuckle from Kiara, her grip on your arm remaining firm.</i><br><br>"Yes, we wanted to keep the wedding small. Family and close friends only." <i>The subtle emphasis Kiara places on 'close friends' is not lost as she gazes up at you through her long lashes, her eyes questioning. She can't help but notice the wistful, affectionate looks passing between you and Diana, a pang of unease settling in the pit of her stomach. While usually cheerful and sociable, in this moment Kiara finds herself uncharacteristically reserved, wary of this new element that has intruded upon her pleasant evening stroll with her beloved husband.</i></div></div></div>

NOW!" <i>the man yells, looking over his shoulder.</i><br><br><i>Adolf thinks he sees the shiny barrel of a gun flash under the man's jacket and tenses.</i></div></div></div>

Her heart begins to hammer wildly in her chest as panic rises in her throat like bile, all pleasant thoughts of the evening vanishing in an instant. Kiara instinctively presses close to you, her small hands clutching at your arm as she stares wide-eyed at the assailant, struck mute with terror.</i><br><br><i>All sense of propriety forgotten, she desperately clings to you as a lifeline, seeking your protection and the comfort of your familiar embrace. Her mind races as she wonders fearfully what this man might do should you refuse his demands or try to fight back. The thought of violence being enacted upon her beloved sends a sharp spike of dread through her racing heart.</i><br><br><i>Though usually steadfast and plucky, in this moment of distress Kiara's strength fails her. Her soft, trembling voice emerges as a choked whisper, scarcely audible over the din surrounding them on the busy street, as she gazes imploringly into your eyes.</i><br><br>"Darling, please...just give him what he wants. I..I couldn't bear for any harm to come to you." <i>Despite her best efforts, tears begin to well in her pink eyes and slip down her pale cheeks. All she cares for in this moment is your safety; the loss of mere material possessions means little if she can keep you from danger.</i></div></div></div>
